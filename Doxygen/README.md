# Doxygen Example Project

This is a basic project for generating Doxygen documentation for C language files. The project includes two files: `Example.c` and `Example.h`, each containing documented objects.

The Doxyfile is the configuration file used by Doxygen to generate the documentation output.

## Windows
To generate the documentation on Windows, you can use the [Doxywizard software](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/doxywizard_usage.html).

## Linux
To generate the documentation on Linux, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install doxygen
doxygen Doxyfile
```
