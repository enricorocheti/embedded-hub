# Unity Example Project

This is a basic project to explore Unity. Unity is a lightweight and easy-to-use C testing framework. To learn more, visit [Unity's official documentation](https://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity). 

The repository includes a simple module (`Module.c` and `Module.h`) and associated unit tests to explore Unity's features.

## Running the test
To generate the documentation on Linux, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir Build     # creates a build directory
make            # run the tests
```

Test results will be displayed in the terminal and saved to `Build/Test/TestModule.txt`.
